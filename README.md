# EmployeeFeedback
An Employee feedback system will help a manager to review the feedback of all the team members working in a project. Every employee in a team will be able to provide a feedback of any other team member of his/her team.
This will really help the manager in knowing what team members feel about each other and can be really crucial in team building.

Steps for Team Member -
1.	Every Team member will login using his/her credentials(Username/Password)
2.	A Team member will select any other team member for whom he/she wants to give a feedback. This feedback is an answer based on the predefined questions set by the system.
3.	This Feedback will be submitted and can only be reviewed by the manager.


Steps for Manager –
1.	Manager will login into the system using his/her credentials(Username/Password).
2.	Manager can select any team member and see what all feedback were given against him but cannot see who gave the same.
